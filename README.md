I started to make some music using (analog) synths, but I only have
monophonic synthesizers and a drum machine.  I still need something
simple and polyphonic for strings and chords.

I already wrote a simple interactive sequencer in Perl, so why not try
to roll my own soft-synth?  It's a lot more fun to tinker than to
choose an existing soft-synth and read a manual ;-)
