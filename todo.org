* [4/4] prototyping

- [X] working pulse sound output
- [X] simple oscillator
- [X] MIDI in
- [X] note on/note off

* [5/5] todos

- [X] build pipeline
- [X] play corresponding notes on note on/note off
- [X] play smooth sounds (it's currently awful)
- [X] switch to mono output as long as there is no stereo data
- [X] find a better name than /synth/

* [12/24] features

- [ ] variable sample rate
- [ ] refactor duplicated code in error handling (in input and output)
- [X] [5/5] more oscillators
  - [X] sine
  - [X] triangle
  - [X] sawtooth up
  - [X] sawtooth down
  - [X] wavelets (which?)
- [ ] support modulation (eg. pulsewidth on squarewave)
- [X] use MIDI program change to switch oscillators
- [X] multiple oscillators simultaneously?
- [X] polyphony
- [X] switch stop oldest/newest note on polyphony overflow
- [ ] phazor effect?  find out how to make atmospheric strings
- [ ] stereo output?
- [X] ADSR envelope
- [X] configure ADSR parameters via MIDI controls
- [X] support velocity on note on/note off
- [ ] support aftertouch?
- [X] add some status output
- [ ] use main thread for some commands (like quit)
- [ ] re-using an active lane does not reset the envelope.value of
  that lane; decide whether that is a bug or a feature
- [ ] global amplifier
- [X] compressor
- [X] support all notes off command
- [X] determine code coverage after tests
- [ ] phase-shift all oscillators so they start at 0
- [ ] provide arpeggiator instead of polyphony
- [ ] [0/4] add filters
  - [ ] basic FIR filter
  - [ ] configurable low pass filter (map to brightness?)
  - [ ] configurable high pass filter (map to ???)
  - [ ] filter envelopes
